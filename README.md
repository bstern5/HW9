# Final Project Details

Find more details here:
Here I will be putting most of the data necessary for the final project!!

There will be R Scripts included, as well as draft plots, and excel files.
One such excel file is used in our scatter plot relaying information about how much 
people trust FF companies (against how prevalent fracking is)

The major commit/push relates to the inclusion of an updated bubble plot
One issue I have for this polished-ish graph relates to the legends. I am having trouble amending them. First, I will work on amending the titles. Additionally, and this is the part I'm more concerned about, I'd like to change the number of bubble sizes to display greater differences in the belief about a scientific consensus on CC.

The metadata for the YCOM dataset is included
